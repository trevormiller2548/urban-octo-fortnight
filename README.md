  ## Installation 
 I started by installing express and later I installed uuid. The key to this project is creating effective routes that allow the app to run smoothly.  

  ## Usage 
  You start by entering npm init in your terminal, follow by node server.js. Then you pull up the server in a window and make your notes. The notes will be saved in db.json and to the side of the app.
